In the previous version, I explained how I gathered information from the game screen using an add-on we designed for this purpose.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
for the farming purpose, I needed a path of coordination I wanted to my character go as its route.<br/>
So i designed a path recorder class that could record the character path and save the list of coordinations in a .txt file.

<br/><br/>
After gathering those information ,i had x,y,facing and all data we needed.<br/>
I could just press the 'W' key to go forward and use the mouse or 'D', 'A' keys to rotate the character's facing angle however still had to find a way to go to the each position.<br/>
